# Project 692
# Applied Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning in predicting stock outcome. 


# I: Overview and Data Collection.
Iâ€™m planning to apply Predictive Analytics and Machine learning technique to analyze and predict the outcome of the data.
The Data source is used SP500, NASDAQ, Dow-Jones, Russell2000, Consumer Confidence Index and Square Inc. and I select Square Inc. to predict the future stock price.  Square Inc is given the trading code name, SQ.   The source data is available in yahoo finance section. 
Yahoo finance provided historical data based on the time range.  There are 6 datasets for this project. First data is SQ dataset and second dataset is SP500. These six datasets will be combined and cleaned before starting to analyze and apply some predictive and machine learning to get an outcome.  The outcome will show the results of a prediction based on the historical and correlation with the SP500 data.  The data collection will be generated from Yahoo finance website in cvs format and import into R. The outcome will provide the information for the future invest on SQ stock.
